# Obsidian Vault Changelog Plugin

This is a simple plugin that add an hotkey for inserting a changelog of recently modified notes in the current vault.

## Development

This project uses Typescript to provide type checking and documentation.  
The repo depends on the latest [plugin API](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api) in Typescript Definition format, which contains TSDoc comments describing what it does.

**Note:** The Obsidian API is still in early alpha and is subject to change at any time!

If you want to contribute to development and/or just customize it with your own
tweaks, you can do the following:

- Clone this repo.
- `npm i` or `yarn` to install dependencies
- `npm run build` to compile.
- Copy `manifest.json`, `main.js` and `styles.css` to a subfolder of your plugins
  folder (e.g, `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/<plugin-name>/`)
- Reload obsidian to see changes
